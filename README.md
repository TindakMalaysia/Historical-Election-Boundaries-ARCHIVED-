For historical and current electoral boundaries, some of the geojson datasets are brought into our updated Github repository: https://github.com/TindakMalaysia/HISTORICAL-ELECTION-RESULTS/tree/main

IT is a requirement that all users ought to read the metadata of every dataset and understand the licensing terms. Even though some licences may excuse the user from attributing the sources, it is highly advisable and encouraged for one to cite the sources found in Metadata. If no sources have been indicated, the minimum attribution needs to be placed would be SPR Malaysia
